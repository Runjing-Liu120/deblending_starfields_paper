We present the results on two sets of experiments on synthetic data.

\subsection{Deblending two stars}

We set up a simple experiment to study the
ability of StarNet to deblend two stars.
On a $20\times20$ pixel image,
we simulate two stars of equal flux at distance $\delta$ pixels apart, and
examine the approximate posterior produced by StarNet (Figure~\ref{fig:deblending_fig}).
When stars are separated by 1.5 pixels, StarNet assigns nearly 100\% probability
of two stars in the image.

    True locations are in blue. Red are detections from the starnet MAP estimate.
    In these examples, Starnet correctly identified the two stars separated by distance $\delta \geq 1.2$,
    but only estimated one star when $\delta \leq 1$.

\subsection{Coverage of credible intervals}

We have seen that on M2, the StarNet 95\% credible interval failed
to contain the ground truth number of stars (Section~\ref{sec:results_on_m2}).
On M2, we attribute this to model mis-specification, specifically due to a poorly
estimated background.

We check the coverage of StarNet credible intervals on synthetic data
to rule out any issues with model mis-specification.
On synthetic data, StarNet again overestimates the number of stars.
On a single simulated image sampled from the prior,
the true number of stars ($N = 1195$),
is still considerably smaller than the 0.01-th percentile of
the approximate posterior distribution (Figure~\ref{fig:starnet_density}).

    \caption{Distribution of 5000 samples of the number of sources from the starnet approximate posterior.

    \label{fig:starnet_density}
\end{figure}

We attribute this over-estimation due to the spatial independence of the apprximate posterior.
Specifically, StarNet \textit{overestimates} the number of sources close to tile boundaries.
Heuristically, for a tile containing
a source located in the interior of the tile
within $\epsilon$ of a boundary (but still far from a corner),
StarNet should assign a probability of $\frac{1}{2}$ for
having one source, and a probability $\frac{1}{2}$ for having none, as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$.
Should this be the case, then over the entire image, which consist of many tiles,
a source on the edge is correctly accounted for: it has a 50-50 chance of being assigned to one tile or another
in the approximate posterior, and the expected number of sources sum to one.

However, we observe empirically that as a source approaches the edge of a tile,
the probability that $N = 1$ approaches a number
slightly \textit{larger} than $\frac{1}{2}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:starnet_edges}).
Therefore, the approximate posterior overestimates the expected number of sources in the full entire image.
If we were to simulate images with the constraint that sources are at least 0.1-pixels from the edge,
then the StarNet approximate posterior has much closer to correct coverage (Figure~\ref{fig:coverage_good})

    \caption{The expected number of sources under the starnet approximate posterior as a function of distance from the edge (in pixels).
    On the left, we place a star on the left-most edge, and move its location $\delta$ pixels to the right.
    On the right, we place a star on the top-left corner, and move its location $\delta$ pixels towards the bottom-right corner.}

    \caption{Coverage test in simulated $100\times100$ images where all true stars are constrained to be 0.1-pixels away from any tile
    boundary.
    We simulate 1000 images from the prior and generative model, and for each image, we compute a $1 - \alpha$-level credible
    interval for the number of stars by taking the $\alpha/2$ and $1 -\alpha/2$-th percentiles of StarNet 5000 samples.
    For each $\alpha$, we plot the observed coverage against the target $1 - \alpha$-level coverage. }
