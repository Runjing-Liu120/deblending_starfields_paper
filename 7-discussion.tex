StarNet employs variational inference and outperforms both an MCMC-based probabilistic cataloger and a non-model-based
procedure in terms of accuracy and runtime.
Under the framework of probabilistic modeling,
StarNet produces catalogs in which uncertainties are captured by a posterior over the set of all catalogs.
Importantly, unlike MCMC, StarNet also has the capacity to scale probabilistic cataloging to process large astronomical surveys.

The quality of StarNet detections is the result of optimizing the forward KL, a different objective than the one traditionally used in variational inference.
Optimizing the forward KL allows the variational posterior to be fit on large amounts of {\itshape complete} data -- the image along with its latent catalog -- generated from the statistical model.
While labeled data from simulators has been used in other astronomy applications to train deep neural networks (see for example~\cite{Lanusse_2017_cmudeeplens} and \cite{huang2019finding}), StarNet is the first training procedure to employ simulated data in a statistical framework: the neural network specifies an approximate Bayesian posterior.

While the current work focuses on PSF models, our methodology can be extended to
include more general sources such as galaxies.
One promising direction is to use a deep generative model for galaxies~\citep{Regier2015ADG, Reiman_2019_gans_deblend, lanusse2020deep, Arcelin_2020}.
Here, a neural network encodes a conditional likelihood of galaxy images given a low-dimensional galaxy representation,
and we would estimate the the galaxy model by re-incoporating the ELBO objective ---
the wake-sleep algorithm is a method that alternates between optimizing
the expected forward KL (sleep phase) to
infer catalogs and optimizing the ELBO (wake phase) to fit the galaxy model.
% Unsurprisingly, the current performance of StarNet is sub-optimal for cataloging
% regions of the
% sky that contain both stars and galaxies, due to model misfit (Appendix~\ref{sec:results_sparse_field}).

The statistical framework in this research lays the foundation for building flexible models to incorporate the cataloging of all celestial objects.
Future astronomical surveys will only expand in terms of the volume of data they are able to amass.
As telescopes peer deeper into space, fields will reveal more sources and images will become more crowded.
The uncertainties in crowded fields necessitate a probabilistic approach.
Our method holds the promise of providing  a scalable inference tool that can meet the challenges of future surveys.
