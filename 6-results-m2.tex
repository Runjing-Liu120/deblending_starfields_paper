First, we validate StarNet using an SDSS image of the Messier 2 (M2) globular cluster,
a crowded starfield found in field 136 of camera column 2 in run 2583.
M2 was also imaged in the ACS Globular Cluster Survey~\citep{Sarajedini_2007}
using the Hubble Space telescope (HST),
which has greater resolution than the Sloan telescope.
The resolution of the HST wide-field channel is 0.05 arcseconds per pixel versus
0.4 arcseconds per pixel in SDSS \citep{hubble_about, sdss_about}.
For this image, whe catalog from this Hubble survey (henceforth the ``HST catalog")
serves as ground truth for validating our results.

Then, we run StarNet on a frame from the DECam survey,
and demonstrate the ability of StarNet to scale to large astronomical surveys.

\subsection{Results on the M2 globular cluster}
\label{sec:results_on_m2}

We first focus on the $100 \times 100$ pixel subimage of M2 that
\cite{Portillo_2017} and \cite{Feder_2019} analyzed with PCAT.
This subimage is located approximately two arcseconds from the heavily saturated core of the cluster;
even in this subimage, the HST catalog contains over 1000 stars with F606W-band magnitudes less than 22.
We include two bands in our model, the SDSS $r$-band and $i$-band.
The SDSS $r$-band and the Hubble F606W band are centered at roughly the same wavelength,
but the wavelength range of the Hubble F606W band is slightly broader.

The cataloging accuracy of StarNet is compared with PCAT and DAOPHOT~\citep{stetson2987daophot}.
DAOPHOT is an algorithmic routine for detecting stars in crowded starfields which does not use a generative model.
This software convolves the observed image with a Gaussian kernel and scans for peaks above a given threshold.
The DAOPHOT catalog of M2 was reported in \cite{An_2008_m2}.


% Both DAOPHOT and the Hubble survey produce a single catalog -- that is, a set of estimated stellar locations and fluxes -- with
% error bars nominally representing marginal uncertainties.
% In the context of probabilistic cataloging (StarNet and PCAT), the posterior
% defines a distribution over catalogs.
% Each sample from the (approximate) posterior returns a catalog, and each
% sampled catalog may have different cardinally.

To evaluate the three methods, the HST catalog was used as ground truth.
We filtered the HST catalog to stars with magnitudes smaller than 22.5 in the Hubble F606W band,
because stars with lower apparent brightness cannot be detected in SDSS images.


Estimated catalogs are evaluated on three metrics: the true positive rate (TPR),
the positive predicted value (PPV), and the F1 score.
The TPR is the proportion of stars in the HST catalog matched with a star in the estimated catalog;
the PPV is the proportion of stars in the estimated catalog matched with a star in the HST catalog.
The F1 score summarizes the two metrics as the harmonic mean of the PPV and the TPR.

Like \cite{Portillo_2017} and \cite{Feder_2019}, a ``match" between an estimated star
and an HST star is defined as follows: (1) the estimated location and the HST location are within 0.5 SDSS pixels,
and (2) the estimated SDSS $r$-band flux and the HST F606W band flux are within half a magnitude.
% The slack in magnitude accounts for the fact that the wavelength range of the HST F606W band is slightly broader than the SDSS $r$-band (though they are centered at roughly the same wavelength).

In probabilistic cataloging (PCAT and StarNet), the posterior defines a distribution over catalogs.
For StarNet, the TPR, PPV, and F1 score were computed for the catalog corresponding to the mode of the variational distribution (henceforth, the StarNet catalog).
For PCAT, 300 catalogs were sampled using MCMC; the metrics were computed for each sampled catalog and averaged.

    \label{fig:example_subimages}
\end{figure}

StarNet produced a catalog that outperforms DAOPHOT and PCAT in F1 score (Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats}).
Figure~\ref{fig:example_subimages} shows the StarNet catalog alongside PCAT, DAOPHOT, and HST catalogs.
DAOPHOT estimated less than half the number of stars when compared to the other methods.
It therefore had a large PPV but a small TPR.
The StarNet catalog had about the same TPR as PCAT while being ten points higher in PPV.

Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats} also prints the number of stars inferred by each method.
For probabilistic methods (StarNet and PCAT),
 we display the mean number of stars under the approximate posterior, along with the 5-th and 95-th quantiles.
There are 1114 stars in the HST catalog.
Neither PCAT nor StarNet captured the true number of stars in their 90\% credible interval,
but the StarNet credible intervals were three times wider than the PCAT intervals.
The small PCAT credible intervals may be indicative of an MCMC sampler that failed to mix well.

\input{tables/summary_stats_m2.tex}

The improvement of StarNet over PCAT in PPV was most pronounced for dim stars (Figure~\ref{fig:summary_stats}).
The TPR for StarNet was uniformly better than DAOPHOT across almost all magnitudes.
Of all methods, StarNet best approximated the HST flux distribution (Figure~\ref{fig:luminosity_fun_m2}).
% PCAT overestimated the number of dim stars with magnitudes greater than 21.
% In contrast, DAOPHOT failed to find stars with magnitudes greater than $21$.

% StarNet-WS returns a well-defined distribution over the set of all catalogs
% and is thus able to capture uncertainties in catalog construction.
% Samples from the StarNet-WS variational distribution are compared with samples from PCAT in Figure~\ref{fig:example_subimages_sampled}.
To examine the uncertainty calibration of StarNet, we evaluated the approximate posterior
conditional on the true number of stars in the HST catalog.
Then, each star in the StarNet catalog was matched with exactly one Hubble star by finding the permutation of Hubble stars that had the largest log-likelihood under our variational distribution $q_\eta$.
For each star, we computed the z-score $(y - \hat \mu) / \hat \sigma$, where $y$ is the HST log-flux or
logit-location; $\hat \mu$ and $\hat\sigma$ are the mean and the standard deviation, respectively, of the Gaussian variational distribution for the log-flux or logit-location.
% If the uncertainties were perfectly calibrated, the distribution of these z-scores would be a standard Gaussian.
The empirical z-score distributions are close to a standard Gaussian with some discrepancy in the tails and some evidence of skewness, suggesting the uncertainties are not too mis-estimated (Figure~\ref{fig:z-score_calibration}).

% Figure~\ref{fig:cmd_m2} displays the estimated color-magnitude diagrams. While the Hubble F606W-band corresponds roughly to the SDSS $r$-band, there is no such correspondence for the SDSS $i$-band. Thus, using the Hubble locations, we estimated the $i$-band fluxes using maximum likelihood: letting $x^{(i)}$ be the SDSS image in the $i$-band, $N_H$ the number of stars in the Hubble catalog and $\ell_H$ their locations, solve
% \begin{align}
%   f^{(i)}_H = \argmax_{f\in\mathbb{R}^{N_H}} \log p(x^{(i)} | N_H, \ell_H, f)
%   \label{eq:optim_iband_flux},
% \end{align}
% where the log likelihood is given by the generative model from Section~\ref{sec:gen_model}.
% The estimated $i$-band fluxes and the reported Hubble F606W-band fluxes $f_H^{(r)}$ define the ``true" colors, $2.5\log(f_H^{(i)}/f_H^{(r)})$.
% In the color magnitude diagram, DAOPHOT did not capture the full spectrum of colors; of all three methods, PCAT best captured the color spectrum. All three methods however, were able to capture the arm thing (TODO there is a name for this ... main sequence turnoff?) that branches off at low magnitudes.

% Figure~\ref{fig:loglik_table} displays the log-likelihood under the default SDSS estimates of the PSF and background compared with the estimates found using wake-sleep.
% The wake-sleep estimates improved the log-likelihood.
% We also compared against the ``Hubble estimate" of the background and PSF, obtained by minimizing $- \log p_\phi(x | N_{H}, \ell_{H}, f_{H})$ for $\phi$ directly.

% The results suggest that the primary source of model misfit is the background. A significant increase in log-likelihood occurred by switching from the SDSS background to the Hubble-estimated background.
% But even using the Hubble-estimated background, switching from the SDSS PSF to our wake-sleep PSF improves the log-likelihood.
