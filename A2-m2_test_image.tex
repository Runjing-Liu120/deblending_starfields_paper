The initial $100\times100$ subregion of M2 considered in our main paper was located at pixel coordinates (630, 310) in SDSS run 2583, field 136, camera column 6. 
We evaluate StarNet on two other subregions of M2.
The first is another $100\times100$ pixel subregion of similar density as the original;
the second is in the center of globular cluster
(Figure~\ref{fig:m2_test_regions})
