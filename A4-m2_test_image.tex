We evaluate StarNet on another subregion of M2.
The initial $100\times100$ subregion of M2 considered in our main paper was located at pixel coordinates (630, 310) in SDSS run 2583, field 136, camera column 6. 
After fitting StarNet on this initial region $x_0$, we evaluate StarNet on a neighboring region $x_{test}$. See Figure~\ref{fig:marked_m2} for locations of the considered subregions. 

The subregion $x_{test}$ has approximately $25\%$ more stars than $x_0$ (1413 Hubble detections in $x_{test}$ versus 1114 detections in $x_0$). 
Due the increased density, all methods suffered an $\approx10$ percentage point decrease in F1 score on $x_{test}$ compared to the F1 score on $x_0$ (compare Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats} and \ref{tab:summary_stats_m2test}).

In Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats_m2test} and Figure~\ref{fig:summary_stats_m2test},
``StarNet-init" refers to the wake-sleep trained network on $x_0$. 
Using StarNet-init and its fitted background and PSF as an initialization, we ran two further cycles of wake-sleep on $x_{test}$ (StarNet-refit). 
StarNet-refit improved the PPV over Starnet-init by two percentage points. 
The TPR appeared to be nearly identical across all magnitudes (Figure~\ref{fig:summary_stats_m2test}). 

These results suggest that StarNet-init extrapolates well to neighboring regions, and re-running wake-sleep is not necessary. 
Evaluating StarNet-init on $x_{test}$ took 30 milliseconds. 
On the other hand, re-running PCAT takes another 30 minutes. 
Even if StarNet did require refitting, the subsequent wake-sleep cycles takes only an additional three minutes. 
The amortization enables StarNet inference to have much better scaling characteristics than PCAT.
